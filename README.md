# nanoSint 
This repository contains scripts related to modelling the diffusion process between nanoparticles. The diffusion between particles is tracked using a Phase Field Modelling (PFM) approach. These simulations use density and crystal order parameters as the phase field variables, tracking the diffusion process through the temporal evolution of the phase field variables. Evolution of the density variable is governed with the Cahn-Hilliard equation and the order parameter with the Landau-Gizburg equation. 

# Code breakdown
The scripts used for these simulations are divided into three major categories, the pre-processing bedGeneration scripts, the sintering simulation scripts, and the post-processing imaging and analysis scripts.
